Hello,

As requested on the test I have created one static page 
where I have followed the tasks by creating 2 sections as instructed
in the email: 

Link1: https://shero.d.pr/i/9v153Y
Link2: https://shero.d.pr/i/KcwBqJ

...and another section where I have used Glide.js library
to create the carousel. Meaning that the header, the footer
and the testimonials section were not needed for this test
as instructed in your email.

For each CSS file, JS file and images I have created each 
a folder for storing the files. I have used placeholders as 
images as was requested and the site has been designed to be 
responsive.
